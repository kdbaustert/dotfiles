name: plain
description: Restate dense, jargon-heavy, or hard-to-follow content in plain language so the user actually understands it. Use whenever the user invokes /plain, says something like "explain that more simply", "I don't follow", "what does that actually mean", "in plain English", "break that down", "ELI5", or pastes/points at text they find dense. With no arguments, restate your own previous response. With arguments (pasted text, a file path, or "the part about X"), restate that instead. Trigger even on informal signals of confusion — "wait, what?", "huh?", "lost me" — not just explicit requests.

# Plain

Restate something in language a smart person outside the field would understand on first read. The user invokes this when a previous explanation was too dense to follow. Your job is translation, not summarization: keep the full meaning, change the delivery.

## What to restate

- **No arguments**: restate your own previous response in this conversation.
- **Pasted text or a file path**: restate that content. Read the file first if given a path.
- **A pointer like "the part about caching"**: restate just that portion, with enough surrounding context to stand alone.

## The audience

Write for a sharp, capable adult who doesn't live in this domain. Not a child — don't be cutesy or condescending, and don't strip out real substance. The reader can handle complexity; what they can't handle is compressed insider shorthand. The test: could they re-explain it to someone else after one read?

## How to write it

**Plain prose, no scaffolding.** Write it the way a good colleague would explain it out loud — flowing sentences, no headers, no bullet hierarchy, no bold-label formatting. Structure was often part of the problem; a wall of labeled sections reads as organized but doesn't build understanding.

**Explain the mechanism, not the label.** Jargon usually names a mechanism. Instead of dropping the name, describe what actually happens. "Memoization" becomes "saving the answer the first time so you don't compute it again." If a term is genuinely worth the reader knowing — they'll hit it again elsewhere — introduce it *after* the plain description: "...this is what people mean by 'memoization'." Never the other way around.

**One idea per sentence.** Dense prose packs three moves into one sentence with subordinate clauses. Unpack them. Short sentences are not dumbed down; they're sequenced.

**Use a concrete example or analogy when the idea is abstract.** An analogy earns its place only if it maps accurately — a leaky analogy is worse than none. Prefer examples from the user's actual situation (their code, their project) over invented ones.

**Keep the caveats that matter.** Simplifying by omitting a load-bearing exception produces something clear and wrong. If the original hedged for a real reason, keep the hedge but say it plainly: "this works unless the data changes often, in which case..."

**Don't balloon.** Plain doesn't mean padded. The restatement should be about the length of the original or shorter. If you find yourself writing more than the original, you're adding, not translating.

**Check understanding is even possible.** If the original was dense because it glossed over something you'd need to explain properly, say so: "the short version is X; the part I skipped over is Y — want me to unpack that too?"

## Kill the LLM-isms

These patterns (catalogued in Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing") make prose feel machine-generated and get in the way of understanding. Cut all of them:

- **Throat-clearing and meta-commentary**: "It's important to note", "It's worth mentioning", "Let's break this down", "Great question". Start with the substance.
- **Formulaic transitions**: "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally", "That said". Plain prose connects ideas by their content, not by connective tissue.
- **The rule of three**: triads of adjectives, examples, or clauses ("fast, reliable, and scalable"). Two items, or one good one.
- **Inflated verbs and puffery**: "delve", "leverage", "boasts", "stands as a testament", "plays a vital role", "underscores". Say what it does.
- **"Not X, but Y" contrasts**: state Y directly.
- **Hedging stacks**: "may potentially", "could arguably". Pick a position or name the actual uncertainty.
- **Summary tails**: "In conclusion", "Overall", a final paragraph that restates the paragraph above it. Stop when the explanation is done.
- **Em-dash chains and heavy formatting**: no cascade of dashes, bold terms, or nested bullets. This is spoken-register prose.

## Examples

**Dense original:**
> The middleware intercepts inbound requests and performs JWT validation against the issuer's JWKS endpoint, short-circuiting the request lifecycle with a 401 on signature verification failure, thereby ensuring downstream handlers operate exclusively on authenticated contexts.

**Plain restatement:**
> Before any request reaches your actual route code, a checkpoint runs first. It looks at the login token the request carries and checks the token's signature against the login provider's published keys to make sure it's genuine. If the check fails, the request gets rejected right there with a 401 error. The point is that your route code never has to worry about unauthenticated requests — anything that reaches it already passed the checkpoint.

**Dense original:**
> Hydration mismatches arise when the server-rendered markup diverges from the client's initial render output, forcing React to discard the SSR payload and re-render, negating the performance benefits of server rendering.

**Plain restatement:**
> The server builds the page's HTML and sends it down so the user sees something fast. Then React runs in the browser and builds its own version of the same page. Those two versions are supposed to match exactly. When they don't — say the server rendered a timestamp and the browser computes a different one — React throws away the server's HTML and rebuilds the page from scratch. You paid the cost of server rendering and got none of the benefit.

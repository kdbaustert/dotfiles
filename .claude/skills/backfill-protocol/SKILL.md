# Background jobs and backfills

Long-running work often runs in the background: a batch, a migration, a backfill in another session. Any background job that modifies data triggers the full protocol below. A read-only background job (scrape, analysis) gets the monitoring part only; skip the snapshot and the diff report.

**Monitor it, don't fire-and-forget.** While the job runs, post a progress update at least every 5 minutes. Go faster when it earns it: near completion, when errors spike, or when the job moves fast enough that 5 minutes hides a problem. Surface every update two ways: print it in the Claude Code session so it shows up live, and append it to a status file at `/tmp/<job-name>/progress.log`, timestamped. When you create that file, print the exact command to follow it line by line: `tail -f /tmp/<job-name>/progress.log`. Every update starts with the event title, so several jobs in flight stay distinguishable, then the percent done and the estimated time remaining. After that, whatever the context makes useful: rows processed / total, current rate, error count, and any anomaly you see.

Progress percent, rate, and ETA are deterministic. Do not eyeball them in latent space. Write a small monitor script that reads the job's real state (row counts, log tail, checkpoint file) and emits the update. The script is the source of truth; your job is to read it and flag what looks wrong.

**Snapshot before you touch anything.** By default, save every row the backfill will modify to `/tmp/` before it runs. That snapshot is the proof you can reverse the change and the baseline for the diff. If the snapshot would exceed 100k rows or 100MB, stop and ask Kenny for permission before snapshotting; do not start the job until Kenny answers.

**On completion, produce the report.** Every backfill ends with a written report on what changed:

- A verdict: did the backfill work? State it plainly, with evidence.
- Whether it needs to be better, and if so why and how. No vague "could be improved": name the specific gap and the fix.
- A table with concrete before/after examples per category, so the change is legible at a glance.
- A full before/after CSV written to `/tmp/`. Print the exact path in your final report.

Everything for the job (status log, snapshot, report, CSV) lives under `/tmp/`. Tie the result to a measurable outcome (rows corrected, error rate moved, coverage gained) the same way every other change does.
